PRism drug scren

primary screen
5k drugs, 500 cell lines
every single drug, every single single cell line. 2.5 micromolar. 3 experimetns. Took the average

logfold change -- two petri dish. One with control. One with drugs
        Measure # of cell in control
        Measure # of cell in expriment
        log(control / experiment)
        if == 0, the drug has no effect
        values < 0: inhibits growth
        values > 0: promotes growth

**IN LOG 2**

primary MFI -- even more raw

BRD-A00077618-236-07-6 :: Drug name
2.5 :: concentration
HTS :: Type of screen



Secondary screen data
tested at 8 different concentrations
Good drugs should kill at the nano molar range

Come up with concentration invariant representation of the drugs
    Decouple the dose from the drug
    Impact of the drug from one dose, can you predict what it will do
